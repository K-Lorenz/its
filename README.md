# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up the project and understand its structure. Follow the steps below to start development.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Recommended installation via [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).  
  Using NVM allows you to easily switch between Node versions if working on multiple projects.
- **Code Editor**: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended, along with these extensions for development:
  - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
  - ESLint
  - TypeScript

> **Note**: In the current setup, the project wont build if ESLint throws **any errors or warnings**.

## Setting Up the Project

Follow these steps to install and start the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Use `git clone https://github.com/K-Lorenz/its` to get the project files.

2. **Open the Project**:  
   Navigate to the folder containing the cloned files.

3. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Run the following command in the terminal:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   > *Shortcut for VS Code*: Press ``CTRL + SHIFT + ` `` to open an integrated terminal.

4. **Start the Development Server**:  
   Launch the app with:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:  
   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Editing the Application

- To modify the main page, edit the file: `app/page.tsx`.  
- Changes will automatically reflect in the browser upon saving.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Main Route (`/`)**
- **File**: `app/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: This is the Main Page of the application. Here the inputmask aswell as all the steps are displayed. It serves as the default route when users visit the root URL (`/`).

### 2. **Edit Route (`/edit`)**
- **Folder**: `app/edit/`
- **File**: `app/edit/page.tsx`
- **Purpose**: A secondary route for editing functionality. This is where users can modify data.

### 3. **Shared Layout**
- **File**: `app/layout.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Provides a shared structure across all pages, such as a navigation bar, footer, or global styles.

---

## Components

- **Directory**: `components/`
- **Purpose**: Contains reusable UI components used throughout the application.  
  - **Examples**: A markdown editor and display component, a step-by-step process component.

Using components improves consistency and reduces duplication in the codebase.

---

## How the Application Works

Hereâ€™s how the various parts of the application work together:

1. **Routing**: Next.js automatically generates routes based on the `app/` folder structure.  
2. **Layouts**: The `layout.tsx` file ensures consistent structure across pages.  
3. **Components**: Reusable elements from `components/` are imported and used in pages or layouts.  
4. **Modular Pages**: Each page is its own isolated module, making development and debugging straightforward.
